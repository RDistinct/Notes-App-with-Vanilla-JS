//THIS IS WHAT THE APP WILL CONTAIN

//A "New Note" button that opens a modal that will be used to create a note.
//Inside that modal, a text field to input our data, an "Add Note" button to add the new note, & "close" button to close the modal
//The app will be progressive, we might add local storage to save our note items, & other features.
